# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

This Project with TripleTen is centered around the utilization of Grid and Flex boxes, and applying those skills to develop responsive web designs! The two main resolutions were 1280p (Desktop) and 320p (Smartphone), with a bridge in between for tablet resolutions!

This project took 3-4 days to complete, and it was my first opportunity working with Figma!
